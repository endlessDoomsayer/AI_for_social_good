(Slide 1: The Idea: AI for Actionable Carbon Reduction)

"Hello everyone. We are happy to show you our project today. Our project uses AI, or Artificial Intelligence, to help with a big world problem: reducing carbon emissions.

The problem we chose is how to reduce carbon emissions. Climate change is very serious, and we need new, simple ways to use clean energy.

But we wanted our project to be more than just an idea. We wanted to make something feasible for a real-world scenario. So, we built an AI system that is not just for study. It is a tool that gives real, usable results for real life.

"So, what did we build? Let's look at our solution."

(Slide 2: Our Solution: Personalized Renewable Energy Planning)

"This is our solution: an AI system for Personal Energy Plans.

Our software uses real data. It gives users special advice, based on data, to help them use clean energy.

What does it do?

First, based on the location and the consumption give in input. The AI looks at the energy needs of a company or a house.

Then, it tells you the Best System Size. This means it finds the best number of solar panels and the right size for a battery, just for you.

And very important, it checks the Cost. Our system tells you how many years it will take to get your money back from buying the panels and battery. This makes the decision easier.

But how do we find the best plan? It's not just about buying things. It's about using energy in a smart way."

"Let's see how our AI helps with this smart energy use."

(Slide 3: Intelligent Optimization: Smart Energy Use)

"This slide shows how our software finds the Best Plan and helps with Smart Energy Use.

How does our system work?

First, it Looks at How You Use Energy. The AI carefully studies how much energy a house or company uses, and when it uses it during the day and year.

With this information, the AI gives Smart Energy Advice. It helps users choose how and when to use their energy. It tries to match energy use with the clean energy they make.


"So, this is the main idea of our project. We use AI to make clean energy choices easy to understand and very useful for everyone."
