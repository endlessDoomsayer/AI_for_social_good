# A multiphase AI approach for carbon emission reduction: optimizing solar integration and industrial operations
The following is the code for the AI for social good project of AI course at Unipd.

## Structure of the project
The project is divided in 3 parts:
- `weather_pv_conversion` contains the code to predict the production of solar panels based on weather information taken from OpenMeteo API.
- `nilm` contains the code that produced the JSON file containing all the machine information and the interface to it.
- `scheduling_problem` contains both the models for the four phases and the code to solve them

To understand better the various parts, please refer to the corresponding `README.md` files.
