    "LOCAL SEARCH:\n",
    "* we can solve a CSP and then use a local search to optimize. IDEA OF LOCAL SEARCH: start from a feasible point, and then see what are its neighbors. Find the highest value neighbor and see if its value is higher than the one we are using right now. If yes, go to it. (HILL-CLIMBING, problem is I can get stuck in a local minimum/maximum). So we can use:\n",
    "   * stochastic hill-climbing: choose a neighbor at random from those that are better\n",
    "   * do a series of hill-climbing and return the best\n",
    "   * simulated annealing: do a move at random. Accepted if improving, if not then it is accepted with a probability that depends on the time. (REALLY OFTEN USED IN AIRLINE SCHEDULING).\n",
    "   * LOCAL BEAM: start from K states, at each step go in all neighbors till I find the goal\n",
    "   * GENETIC ALGORITHMS: combine various states to obtain only one\n",
    "\n",
    "CSP:\n",
    " * to get one value per variable that satisfies all the constraints. The idea is that we use general purpose heuristics rather than problem-specific ones. \\\n",
    "A state is an assignment of values to some or all variables. We want consistent (doesn't violate any constraint) and complete states. \\\n",
    "ANY CSP CAN BE CONVERTED TO A CSP WITH ONLY BINARY CONSTRAINTS.\n",
    "   * BACKTRACKING SEARCH: start from empty assignment and assign a value that do not conflict (depth first). Backtrack if no legal values.\n",
    "   * IMPROVED BACKTRACKING:\n",
    "     * always choose the variable with fewest legal values (break ties choosing the variable involved in the most constraints with unassigned variables).\n",
    "     * Then, chosen a variable, choose the least constraining value (the one that rules out the fewest values in the other variables).\n",
    "     * instead of chronological backtracking (backtrack to the previous variable), do BACKJUMPING: backtrack to a variable that might fix the problem.\n",
    "     * add the constraint on the variables that caused the problem (NO-GOOD) to avoid to redo the error\n",
    "     * FORWARD CHECKING: if any of the remaining variable has no legal values, terminate.\n",
    "     * CONSTRAINT PROPAGATION: enforce local consistency. It's a preprocessing step (or also done after assigning a new value). This doesn't guarantee to solve the problem, but helps pruning it:\n",
    "       * node-consistency: a variable is node-consistent if all the values in the domain satisfy the variable's unary constraints. If I check this, I can delete all the unary constraints\n",
    "       * arc-consistency (AC-3): a variable is arc-consistent if all the values in the domain satisfy the binary constraints (we are assuming that every other constraint is converted to binary).\n",
    "       * path-consistency: consistency between more than 2 variables\n",
    "   * LOCAL SEARCH: start from something that violates the constraints and try to do small changes (one value to one variable) to get the right solution. The search space is all the complete assignments, we need to find one that is consistent. \\\n",
    "To evaluate states we associate the number of constraints it violates.\n",
    "     * MIN-CONFLICTS: We choose the next value to minimize the number of conflicts.\n",
    "     * IMPROVED:\n",
    "       * RESTART: re-initialize the search after tot steps\n",
    "       * RANDOM WALK: choose something at random but based on probability\n",
    "       * TABU SEARCH: remember a list of forbidden states (few) to avoid cycling.\n",
    "       * CONSTRAINT WEIGHTING: eah constraint has a weight. At each step choose a variable with lowest total weight of all violated constraints. (low weight = more important).\n",
    "\n",
    "LOCAL SEARCH is really useful if I found a good scheduling but there are some minor changes during the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "CONNECTED COMPONENTS: of the constraint graph are different problems that can be solved alone. For example if it's a tree it's easier. SO WE CAN FIX SOME VARIABLES TO OBTAIN A TREE (TREE DECOMPOSITION)."
