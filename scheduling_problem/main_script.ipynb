    "# Algorithms to solve the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local search\n",
    "We can begin by solving a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) to obtain a feasible solution, and then apply local search techniques to optimize it further.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of local search is to start from a feasible solution and explore its neighboring solutions. If a neighbor has a better value (e.g., higher utility or lower cost), we move to that neighbor. This approach is known as hill-climbing. However, a major limitation is that it can get stuck in local optima (either minima or maxima).\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, several strategies can be used:\n",
    "   * Stochastic hill-climbing: Rather than always choosing the best neighbor, randomly select one from among the better neighbors.\n",
    "   * Multiple restarts: Perform several hill-climbing runs from different starting points and return the best solution found.\n",
    "   * Simulated annealing: At each step, select a random move. If the move improves the solution, accept it; if not, accept it with a probability that decreases over time. This method is particularly popular in applications like airline scheduling.\n",
    "   * Local beam search: Start with k different initial states and, at each iteration, consider all their neighbors, selecting the best k to continue. The process repeats until a goal is found.\n",
    "   * Genetic algorithms: Maintain a population of candidate solutions. New candidates are generated by combining existing ones (e.g., via crossover), and selection favors high-quality solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSP\n",
    "The goal is to assign one value to each variable such that all constraints are satisfied. Instead of relying on problem-specific strategies, we apply general-purpose heuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "A state represents an assignment of values to some or all variables. We aim to reach states that are both consistent (do not violate any constraints) and complete (all variables assigned).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Any Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) can be transformed into an equivalent CSP involving only binary constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving CSPs:\n",
    "   * BACKTRACKING SEARCH: Begin with an empty assignment and use depth-first search to assign values that don't cause conflicts. If no valid values are available, backtrack.\n",
    "   * IMPROVED BACKTRACKING:\n",
    "     * Variable Selection: Choose the variable with the fewest legal values. If tied, prefer the one involved in the most constraints with unassigned variables.\n",
    "     * Value Selection: For the selected variable, pick the value that eliminates the fewest options for other variables (i.e., the least constraining value).\n",
    "     * Backjumping: Instead of backtracking to the most recent assignment, backtrack directly to the variable most likely to resolve the conflict.\n",
    "     * No-Good Recording: Learn from failures by recording combinations of variable assignments that lead to dead ends, preventing repeated mistakes.\n",
    "     * Forward Checking: After each assignment, eliminate inconsistent values from the domains of remaining variables. If any domain becomes empty, backtrack.\n",
    "     * Constraint Propagation: Enforce local consistency to prune the search space:\n",
    "       * Node Consistency: Each value in a variableâ€™s domain satisfies all its unary constraints.\n",
    "       * Arc Consistency (e.g., AC-3 algorithm): Every value in a variableâ€™s domain is consistent with some value in the connected variableâ€™s domain under binary constraints.\n",
    "       * Path Consistency: Ensures consistency across chains involving more than two variables.\n",
    "### Local search for CSP\n",
    "This approach begins with a complete assignment that may violate some constraints, then makes small changesâ€”typically modifying the value of one variable at a timeâ€”to move toward a valid solution. The search space consists of all complete assignments, and the goal is to find one that is consistent (violates no constraints).\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is especially helpful in dynamic scenarios like scheduling, where an initial good solution exists, but small changes are needed due to new constraints or updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "To guide the search, each state is evaluated by counting the number of violated constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Techniques:\n",
    " * Min-Conflicts Heuristic: At each step, select a new value for a variable that results in the fewest constraint violations.\n",
    " * Improvements and Variants:\n",
    "   * Random Restarts: If no solution is found after a set number of steps, restart the process from a new random assignment.\n",
    "   * Random Walk: Occasionally make a random move, with a certain probability, to escape local minima.\n",
    "   * Tabu Search: Keep a short memory (tabu list) of recently visited states to avoid cycling back to them.\n",
    "   * Constraint Weighting: Assign weights to constraints and, at each step, prefer changing variables that are involved in the lowest total weight of violated constraints."
