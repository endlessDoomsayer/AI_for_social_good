    "### Idea\n",
    "We can model the constraints and use CSP or even an informed search if we can obtain a good heuristic and test to see which one performs better (in general it should be the heuristic one since we have problem-specific heuristics).\n",
    "CSP involves discrete variables with finite domain (since every minute can be used).\n",
    "⇒ tutti i CSP possono essere convertiti in CSP con constraints binari: è un timetabling problem\n",
    "which class is offered when and where?\n",
    "HOW TO SOLVE IT:\n",
    "- Full search\n",
    "- Backtracking with some improvements on how to choose variables and order, backjumping, no-good, forward checking, constraint propagation (arc consistency)\n",
    "- Local search: utile se vogliamo fare delle modifiche minime al volo quando cambiano dei requirements \\\n",
    "Anche un SOFT CSP: ogni assignment di valori è associato a un preference value. Di fatto invece che dire “Non posso fare questa cosa” dico “se faccio questa cosa a questa ora è meglio”. Si potrebbe vedere come un Weighted CSP o anche un multi-criteria problem (vogliamo massimizzare/minimizzare due cose assieme)… attenzione che viene fuori anche BRANCH AND BOUND.\n",
